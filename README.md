# Moments

A web application where the users can create an acount and store albums of 'moments' - images they treasure.
The user can both share selective images or albums with other users.

This application comes in handy when e.g. you want to show photos from a trip. Instead of scrolling around thousands of images in their camera album. They only need to click on the chosen album in Moments!
